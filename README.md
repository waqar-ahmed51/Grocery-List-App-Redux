# Grocery-List-App-Redux
  Basic Grocery List App developed with React and Redux - Centralized App State
  
  I started learning Redux after following some resources online I build this application for practice. This is a basic Grocery List App through which users can add, and remove the items to the list. All components are sharing a single state (known as store in redux).
  
  I used react-redux for this practice application.
